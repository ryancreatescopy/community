## Propose your idea

If you want some budget we’ll have to see a proposal first. Follow these steps to propose an idea.

### 1. Write your proposal using our template

We’ve prepared a Google doc template for you to fill in. This should help you structure your proposal so that we get the information we need.

[Open proposal template ↗](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lF8mNuomrguIS3lnvqTomS4NdON40nuyKRbLS6ZkMoA/edit)

### 2. Post your proposal in our chat

Post your complete proposal in our Community Development chat. We meet weekly to review proposals and will be in touch to provide you updates.

[Community chat ↗](https://chat.makerdao.com/channel/community-development)

You’ll be assigned a guide to help you iterate on your proposal, plan the work and manage the feedback process. For more detail on what happens read about the [community project process](community-projects-process.md).
