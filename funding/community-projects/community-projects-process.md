  think might be helpful.

# Community projects process

## Roles

There are a number of roles involved in a community project:

* **Proposal owner**: Creator of the CDIP and the driver of the project. Sets all contributor roles, goals, timelines, and expectations. Can lead meetings or communications.
* **Contributing Team**: Contributes responsibilities or expertise to the owner, or lead.
* **Advisor**: Supportive role that can help scope, follow up, brainstorm, test, and keep Community Development abreast of communications and project updates.
* **Approving Group**: Evaluator\(s\) reviewing and approving proposals – a mix of Maker Foundation employees and seasoned contributors of the community.

## Workflow

Below is a visual representation of our current process.

* Green: proposal owner
* Purple: approving group
* Orange: both

### 1. Submit your proposal

To submit a proposal follow [these instructions](./)

### 2. Wait for feedback

The approving group will reach out to the proposal owner and provide feedback. You’ll work on scoping, costs, resources and timeline.

### 3. Wait for a decision

The approving group meets to discuss which proposals will get funding. We’ll reach out to any successful proposal owners.

### 4. Start work

If it’s a small or medium scoped project and you’ve addressed any feedback, work can then begin.

If it’s a large project, a proposal will need to be split into GitHub issues/tasks and another call with the approving group will be needed to confirm costs and resources.

### 5. Communicate progress

The project will have checkpoints and you will be expected to present progress at Community weekly syncs.

### 6. Evaluate at a retrospective

Once the work is done, there’ll be a review and retrospective to show off the work, discuss what went well and what can be improved.

## Resources

You should outline anything you need in your proposal. For example:

* People support \(developer, designer, editor, writer, videographer, etc\)
* Foundation resources support \(brand assets, official product screenshots, etc\)

If you need more resources than you first thought, let your advisor know. They will coordinate a meeting, outline the required resources, and present them to the approving group. They’ll figure out whether to approve additional resources or not.

### Community resources
