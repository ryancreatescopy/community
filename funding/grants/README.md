# Development grants

## Funding

We fund all kinds of teams creating infrastructure and applications within the Maker ecosystem. So far we’ve awarded 683,887 Dai since February 2018.

### What we fund

* Tools that directly benefit Dai users 
* Tools that increase Dai adoption 
* Tools that increase access to personal liquidity

### What we don't fund

* Pure R&D 
* Information gathering 
* Additional runway 
* Ethereum ecosystem improvements 

We also do not allocate grants that contain large marketing budgets and/or Dai giveaways and airdrops.

{% hint style="info" %}
Due to the high volume of worthy requests we receive and the limited resources available, we prioritize applications that have very conservative budgets.
{% endhint %}

## Requirements

This grant is for teams building on Maker or Dai. You’ll need to:

* [ ] self-direct your own work 
* [ ] commit to regular check-ins 
* [ ] work fast and openly
* [ ] share code repository activity 
* [ ] communicate often – with us and other members of the cohort 
* [ ] split your work into milestones – we distribute blocks of funds as you reach predetermined milestones.

Our grantee playbook should give you more an idea of what’s expected.
