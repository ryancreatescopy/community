# Grantee playbook

## Path to success

The best way to ensure you get your blocks of funds is to make sure you do the following:

* Follow this framework and other requirements docs we’ll send you 
* Build a [social media presence](grantee-playbook.md#social-media-presence) 
* Keep up your [code repo activity ](grantee-playbook.md#code-repo-activity)
* Document your activity with [regular dev posts ](grantee-playbook.md#regular-dev-posts)
* Get to know and help out other grantees – join and [post reguarly in chat.makerdao.com](grantee-playbook.md#post-regularly-in-chat-makerdao-com) 
* Complete roadmap items and show your working via commits or issues 
* Hit milestones on time\(ish\) 
* Actually launch the thing!

Teams that successfully complete their milestones and launch a product may also gain access to internal MakerDAO resources. These resources can take many forms from code reviews and external security audits, to consultations with Legal, Public Relations and/or Business Development teams. Successful projects will also be prioritized for continued granting and or possible investments from MakerDAO in future iterations of the program.

## Successful grantee examples

Here are some projects that were really successful grantees:

[**Burner wallet**](https://xdai.io/)[**↗**](https://xdai.io)  
A mobile phone can send DAI to another in 5 seconds with a simple QR code scan  
  
[**CDP.tools↗**](https://cdp.tools/)  
****APAC region monitoring and alerting for CDPs & Wechat

[**Ching! Store ↗**](https://ching.store/)  
****Create Dai transaction pop-up markets with a white-label POS system.

## Social media presence

Cross promotion is important when getting the word out about the cool projects you are working on. Please follow, like, add, clap, upvote when your fellow teams publish something.

This increased visibility will allow MakerDAO to form PR plans around notable events and product launches.

* Set up a Twitter handle for your team 
* Try to maintain at least weekly activity in the account 
* Follow projects in your space 
* Follow other grantees 
* Identify influencers who might be interested in your project and add them 
* Post links to your blog posts and repos

## Code repo activity

* Ensure that all work is being regularly committed to a repo 
* Regularly track and close issues and pull requests 
* If your repo is private, add [@ghettodev↗](https://github.com/ghettodev) 
* Create a top level `README.md` which contains a detailed description of the project, goals, features, roadmap and installation instructions

The Community Development team will primarily be watching activity in grantee repos to measure project velocity

## Regular dev posts

Each project needs a dedicated blog. [Devpost](https://devpost.com/), [Medium](https://www.medium.com) and Ghost are good options.

Set up a reminder to write a dev post at least once a month, or once per milestone, outlining the progress/challenges/wins, your team has encountered. Include links to repos, demos and social media

## Post regularly in chat.makerdao.com

The chat brings together the entire Maker community \(potentially your future customers\) and experts on Maker.

Ask technical questions in the MakerDAO \#dev channel. The people who built the core MakerDAO ecosystem are all in there, and available for questions.

[Dev chat ↗](https://chat.makerdao.com/channel/dev)

Make sure you and your team join the \#comm-dev-incubate channel. There are many teams working on projects complimentary to the Dai ecosystem so there is a good chance someone there has some ideas about problems you might be facing. It's also a great opportunity to find ways to integrate with other projects in the space.

Please post all status updates, tweets, questions in \#comm-dev-incubate so other grantees can jam on whatever is going on and share social media love
