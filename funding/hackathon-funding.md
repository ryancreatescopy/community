## Development grants

Let your hackers know that they should get on our radar by filling in a development grants application. We often look to award grants to hackathon winners.

## Hackathon help

We’ve prepared a guide to help first-time hackers understand what to expect. You might want to share this with everyone taking part in your hackathon.

If you have some insight you’d like to share, feel free to add to this guide. You can find out how on our [content page](../work-with-us/content/)
