## At your funded meetup

### Promote community development

If we fund your meetup we’ll ask you to speak briefly about Community Development at MakerDAO.

* Direct people here to this site 
* Mention that there are lots of ways to contribute to MakerDAO 
* Mention that we award Dai bounties varying by the type of contribution.

### Take lots of pictures and videos

Recording the talks and hosting them on online can be a very effective way of providing resources for others in your local community to share between each other and even with friends of neighbouring cities and countries. Media provides very useful learning resources, gives you something you can send to people remotely, and generally gives you a larger reach.

## Questions?
