# Working on a bounty

{% hint style="info" %}
_If thereâ€™s a bounty you want to work on, make sure you express interest in the chat before doing anything else._ [_Community chat â†—_](https://chat.makerdao.com/channel/community-development)
{% endhint %}

## The process

### 1. Plan with the community team

Youâ€™ll be assigned advisors and potentially other contributors. Work together to develop a plan that helps you structure your approach.

Youâ€™ll need to figure out:

* Clear, attainable goals
* Realistic timelines and deadlines
* The best way to split up any work
* Roles and responsibilities
* When to sync up

We created a project plan template to help you get what you need.

### 2. Review the resources

Use the resources to help you do your best work.

{% page-ref page="../contributing/writing-style-guide.md" %}

{% page-ref page="../contributing/reviewer-guide.md" %}

{% page-ref page="../contributing/visual-style-guide.md" %}

### 3. Work openly

Start your work in a collaborative Google doc so the contributing team can properly review your work. Be sure to communicate regularly with your team and the wider community. We encourage you to share work, ask for feedback and keep us updated in the [community chat â†—](https://chat.makerdao.com/channel/community-development)

Try and keep the GitHub issue attached to your bounty up to date with comments and feedback.

### 4. Submit a final draft

When your work is ready for final approval, youâ€™ll need to submit a pull request in GitHub and update the GitHub issue.

[How to use GitHub](https://github.com/ryancreatescopy/community/tree/05625ac9da715dde58095901b61bc4e69cd5fe82/content/using-github/README.md)

ðŸ’¡ _If your work is content based youâ€™ll need to copy your content over to HackMD from your Google doc. All content on the site is in markdown._

Once your pull request has been approved weâ€™ll let you know how to request your Dai.

### 5. Help improve the process

Once a bounty has been completed, it would be great if you could let us know what went well and what didnâ€™t. And suggest any ideas you might have for improvements. This can be done on a call or via [community chat â†—](https://chat.makerdao.com/channel/community-development)
