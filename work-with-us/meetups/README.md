## Important disclaimer

These meetups are not for speculating on the price of the token or general hype. The main goal of hosting meetups is to bring people together and educate them about decentralized finance, Dai, and MakerDAO. When talking about the MKR token, the goal should be to educate the attendees about the purpose and utility of the token. Events should focus on the MakerDao ecosystem, how MakerDao and Dai interact with DeFi, decentralized governance, and other relevant topics.

## Get funded

If you’re hosting a meetup that heavily involves Maker or DAI, we might help fund it. Find out if your meetup is eligible.
