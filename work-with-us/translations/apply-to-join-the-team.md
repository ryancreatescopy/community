## Responsibilities

* [ ] **Translate as accurately as possible**  You’ll need to make sure your work conveys the same meaning as the English content and ensure spelling and grammar is correct. 
* [ ] **Translate authentically**  Please don’t just put a document through Google translate. This will disqualify you from any potential payment. 
* [ ] **Translate consistently**  Ensure terms are translated uniformly across all documents. 
* [ ] **Translate with simplicity in mind**  Writing should be plain, simple, and accessible. 
* [ ] **Format consistently**  Ensure that translated documents retain original formatting. 
* [ ] **Follow the style guide**  DAI or Dai? MakerDAO or The Maker Protocol? This and more guidance in the [style guide](../content/writing-style-guide.md)
